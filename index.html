    <h4>Robotics</h4>
    <p> No matter what <em>certain</em> people might say, I am the best programmer on the PPHS Robotics team. I have many reasons for this.</p>
    <ul>Reasons</ul>
      <li class="working">First person to make a working robot which could score points</li>
      <li class="working">First person to make a working autonomous</li>
      <li>First person to make any part of a PID</li>
    <p> As you can see, there is too much of a reason to not call me the lord and savior of Code-Tastrophe, the best robotics team since dank memes</p>
    <h4>"Sports"</h3>
    <p> The subject of this paragraph is mildly amusing because I chose to call it "sports." See, I don't really "do" sports <em> [Nasaly voice] </em> Unless you count e-sports! Anyways, the only sports I'm really "good" at are Cricket and Tennis. You probably don't know what cricket is. It's baseball but it came first, so it's obviously better. As for tennis, you probably know what it is. I also know a little bit about martial arts and I go to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.</p>
    <h4>Games</h3>
    <p> A common question that I get is what I do with my spare time. For the most part, I play video games. I play a lot of CS:Go, a bit of Fortnite, some ShellShock Live, and WAY too much Binding of Isaac. Games, to me, are a way to escape the word that I live in when it gets too boring or stressful. That's why I want to play games for a living.</p>
